# W.A.R. Control for macOS

Waveson Audio Remote Control for macOS taps the media keys/functions* on a Mac keyboard (play, pause, volume, etc) and sends the corresponding commands to another device over a custom Bluetooth Low Energy service.

\* I don't know if this includes the media functions of a Touch Bar; don't have one to try it out.
